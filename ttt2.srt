2
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:30,714
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,433
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,146
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

5
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:54,530
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,392
No! No!

7
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,561
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,862
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,364
No!

10
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,410
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,897
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,150
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,820
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,205
Just a dream.

15
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,558
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

16
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,936
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

17
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,438
It's just where we can't get.

18
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,859
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

19
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,948
I don't think Gandalf meant for us
to come this way.

20
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,869
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

21
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,205
...but they did.

22
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,303
Mr. Frodo?

23
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,641
It's the Ring, isn't it?

24
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,228
It's getting heavier.

25
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,577
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

26
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,371
Oh, yes. Lovely.

27
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,291
Lembas bread. And look!

28
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,004
More lembas bread.

29
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,725
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

30
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,895
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

31
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,274
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

32
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,407
Those rain clouds might.

33
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,507
This looks strangely familiar.

34
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,635
It's because we've been here before.

35
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,346
We're going in circles.

36
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,973
What is that horrid stink?

37
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,309
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

38
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,436
- Can you smell it?
Yes.

39
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,690
I can smell it.

40
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,405
We're not alone.

41
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:04,172
The thieves. The thieves.

42
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,301
The filthy little thieves.

43
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,015
Where is it?

44
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,894
They stole it from us.

45
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:22,274
My precious.

46
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,403
Curse them, we hates them!

47
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,699
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

48
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,506
This is Sting.

49
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,257
You've seen it before...

50
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,927
...haven't you, Gollum?

51
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,434
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

52
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,285
It burns!

53
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,788
It burns us!

54
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,707
It freezes!

55
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,795
Nasty Elves twisted it.

56
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,631
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

57
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,305
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

58
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,058
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

59
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,812
That would kill us! Kill us!

60
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,690
It's no more than you deserve!

61
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,443
Maybe he does deserve to die.

62
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,283
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

63
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,624
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

64
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,627
Take it off us.

65
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,676
We swears to do what you wants.

66
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,761
We swears.

67
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,514
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

68
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,935
We swears...

69
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,898
...to serve the master of the precious.

70
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,861
We will swear on...

71
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,030
...on the precious.

72
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,365
Gollum. Gollum.

73
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,703
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

74
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,872
Yes...

75
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,916
...on the precious.

76
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,713
On the precious.

77
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,382
I don't believe you!

78
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,888
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

79
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,806
He's trying to trick us.

80
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,060
If we let him go,
he'll throttle us in our sleep.

81
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,992
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

82
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,664
You've been there before?

83
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,249
Yes.

84
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,763
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

85
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,621
Merry!

86
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,543
What is it? What do you smell?

87
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,212
Man-flesh.

88
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,172
Aragorn.

89
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,300
They've picked up our trail.

90
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,302
Let's move!

91
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,702
Their pace has quickened.

92
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,663
They must have caught our scent.

93
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,623
Hurry!

94
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,004
Come on, Gimli!

95
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,135
Three days and nights pursuit.

96
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,263
No food. No rest.

97
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,434
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

98
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,052
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

99
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,764
They may yet be alive.

100
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,226
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

101
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,356
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

102
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,819
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

103
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,572
Very dangerous over short distances.

104
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,086
Rohan.

105
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,047
Home of the Horse-lords.

106
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,801
There's something strange at work here.

107
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,929
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

108
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,099
Sets its will against us.

109
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,190
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

110
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,943
The Uruks turn northeast.

111
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,946
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

112
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,073
Saruman.

113
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,668
The world is changing.

114
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:44,465
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

115
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,886
...and Mordor?

116
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:55,184
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

117
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,980
...and the union of the two towers?

118
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,489
Together, my Lord Sauron...

119
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,160
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

120
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,513
The Old World will
burn in the fires of industry.

121
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,351
The forests will fall.

122
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,105
A new order will rise.

123
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:47,070
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

124
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:51,199
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

125
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:05,797
We have only to remove
those who oppose us.

126
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,883
The Horse-Men took your lands.

127
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,554
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

128
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,181
Murderers!

129
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,226
Take back the lands they stole from you.

130
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,186
Burn every village!

131
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,570
It will begin in Rohan.

132
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,866
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

133
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,827
But no more.

134
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,246
Éothain! Éothain!

135
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,084
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

136
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,129
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

137
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,964
He is too big for him.

138
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,134
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

139
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,845
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

140
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,015
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

141
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,935
Freda, I will find you there.

142
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,525
Quickly!

143
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,491
Go, child.

144
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,379
Rohan, my lord...

145
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,423
...is ready to fall.

146
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,658
Théodred.

147
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,509
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

148
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,345
He was ambushed by Orcs.

149
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,517
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

150
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,394
That is a lie.

151
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:32,485
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

152
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,155
Gríma.

153
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:43,538
Gríma.

154
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,375
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

155
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,379
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

156
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,966
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

157
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:08,563
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

158
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,232
Can you not see?

159
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,445
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

160
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,157
...your warmongering.

161
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,327
Warmongering?

162
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,663
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

163
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,875
What was the promised price, Gríma?

164
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,753
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

165
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,894
Too long have you watched my sister.

166
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,062
Too long have you haunted her steps.

167
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,450
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

168
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,784
Too much.

169
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:11,959
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

170
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,420
...under pain of death.

171
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,037
Keep breathing. That's the key.

172
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,997
Breathe.

173
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,922
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

174
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,148
We're not going no further...

175
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,317
...until we've had a breather.

176
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,820
Get a fire going!

177
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,160
Merry!

178
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:35,042
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

179
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,721
What's making that noise?

180
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,724
It's the trees.

181
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,559
What?

182
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,730
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

183
00:21:55,897 --> 00:22:00,401
Folk used to say there was something
in the water that made the trees grow tall...

184
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,069
...and come alive.

185
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,030
Alive?

186
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,574
Trees that could whisper...

187
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,077
...talk to each other...

188
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,079
...even move.

189
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,916
I'm starving.

190
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:20,171
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

191
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,797
Yeah!

192
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,259
Why can't we have some meat?!

193
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,847
What about them?

194
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,932
They're fresh.

195
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,354
They are not for eating.

196
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,278
What about their legs?

197
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,781
They don't need those.

198
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,452
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!

199
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,623
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.

200
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,291
No!

201
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,922
Looks like meat's
back on the menu, boys.

202
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,805
Pippin.

203
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,640
Let's go.

204
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,608
Go on.

205
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,276
Call for help.

206
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,737
Squeal.

207
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,116
No one's going to save you now.

208
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,751
Pippin!

209
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,528
A red sun rises.

210
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,948
Blood has been spilled this night.

211
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,023
Riders of Rohan...

212
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,901
...what news from the Mark?

213
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,016
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

214
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,101
Speak quickly!

215
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:26,106
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

216
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,785
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

217
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,621
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

218
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,707
You would die before your stroke fell.

219
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,301
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

220
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,847
This is Gimli, son of GIóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

221
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:02,268
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

222
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,731
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

223
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,150
Not even his own kin.

224
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,657
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

225
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,742
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

226
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,706
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

227
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,666
And for that, we are banished.

228
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,005
The White Wizard is cunning.

229
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,091
He walks here and there, they say...

230
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,302
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

231
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,974
And everywhere,
his spies slip past our nets.

232
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,351
We are no spies.

233
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,479
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

234
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,107
They have taken
two of our friends captive.

235
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,360
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

236
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,697
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

237
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,867
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

238
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,205
We left none alive.

239
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,751
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

240
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,466
Dead?

241
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,179
I am sorry.

242
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,062
Hasufel! Arod!

243
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:34,526
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

244
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,404
Farewell.

245
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,828
Look for your friends.

246
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,498
But do not trust to hope.

247
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,752
It has forsaken these lands.

248
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,962
We ride north!

249
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,432
It's one of their wee belts.

250
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,239
We failed them.

251
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,464
A Hobbit lay here.

252
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,009
And the other.

253
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,354
They crawled.

254
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,652
Their hands were bound.

255
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,625
Their bonds were cut.

256
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,226
They ran over here.

257
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,064
They were followed.

258
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,985
The belt!

259
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,032
Run!

260
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,079
Tracks lead away from the battle...

261
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,044
...into Fangorn Forest.

262
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,380
Fangorn?

263
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,174
What madness drove them in there?

264
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,945
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

265
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:15,038
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

266
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,296
Come here!

267
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,345
Trees. Climb a tree.

268
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,440
He's gone.

269
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,829
Merry!

270
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,678
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

271
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,354
Run, Merry!

272
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:34,493
Little Orcs.

273
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,995
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

274
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,039
Tree?

275
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,209
I am no tree!

276
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,628
I am an Ent.

277
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,339
A tree-herder.

278
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,466
A shepherd of the forest.

279
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,009
Don't talk to it, Merry.

280
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,970
Don't encourage it!

281
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:57,391
Treebeard, some call me.

282
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,559
And whose side are you on?

283
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,770
Side?

284
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,856
I am on nobody's side...

285
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:10,570
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

286
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,993
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

287
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,745
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

288
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:22,290
Hobbits? Hmm.

289
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:27,337
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

290
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,675
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

291
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,429
They come with fire.

292
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,181
They come with axes.

293
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:43,186
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

294
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,190
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

295
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,235
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

296
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,237
Halflings!

297
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,530
Shire-folk!

298
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,033
Maybe you are...

299
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,953
...and maybe you aren't.

300
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,958
The White Wizard will know.

301
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,711
The White Wizard?

302
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,756
Saruman.

303
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,978
See? See?

304
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,606
We've led you out.

305
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,317
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

306
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,906
Very lucky we find you.

307
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,331
Nice Hobbit.

308
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,250
Oh!

309
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,504
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

310
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,298
A swamp, yes, yes.

311
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,762
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

312
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,518
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

313
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,398
I found it. I did.

314
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,276
The way through the marshes.

315
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,988
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

316
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:21,243
They go around for miles and miles.

317
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,869
Come quickly.

318
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,165
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

319
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,059
There are dead things!

320
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,019
Dead faces in the water.

321
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,820
All dead. All rotten.

322
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,074
Elves and Men and Orcses.

323
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,911
A great battle long ago.

324
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,455
Dead Marshes.

325
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,417
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

326
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,837
This way.

327
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,756
Don't follow the lights.

328
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,341
Oh.

329
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,387
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

330
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,683
...and light little candles of their own.

331
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,419
Frodo!

332
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,551
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

333
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,595
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

334
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,639
Are you all right?

335
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,462
So bright.

336
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,466
So beautiful.

337
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,470
Our precious.

338
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,473
What did you say?

339
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,892
Master should be resting.

340
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,105
Master needs to keep up his strength.

341
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,360
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

342
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,029
Gollum. Gollum.

343
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,989
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

344
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:50,243
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

345
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,995
He said your life was a sad story.

346
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:56,750
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

347
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,919
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

348
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,838
Were you?

349
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,259
Sméagol.

350
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,516
What did you call me?

351
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,604
That was your name once, wasn't it?

352
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,565
A long time ago.

353
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,112
My name.

354
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,538
Sméagol.

355
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,294
Black Riders!

356
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,796
Hide! Hide!

357
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,642
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

358
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,479
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

359
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,899
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

360
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,985
No, you cannot kill them. No.

361
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,264
Wraiths!

362
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,683
Wraiths on wings!

363
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,693
They are calling for it.

364
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,447
They are calling for the precious.

365
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,701
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

366
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,161
I'm here.

367
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,720
Hurry, Hobbits.

368
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:18,183
The Black Gate is very close.

369
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,900
Orc blood.

370
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,703
These are strange tracks.

371
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,998
The air is so close in here.

372
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,585
This forest is old.

373
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,379
Very old.

374
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,425
Full of memory...

375
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,347
...and anger.

376
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,439
The trees are speaking to each other.

377
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,107
Gimli!

378
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,193
Lower your ax.

379
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,487
Oh.

380
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,546
The White Wizard approaches.

381
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,014
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

382
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,859
We must be quick.

383
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,087
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

384
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,089
Where are they?

385
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,843
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

386
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,264
They met someone they did not expect.

387
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,558
Does that comfort you?

388
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,685
Who are you?

389
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,147
Show yourself!

390
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,033
It cannot be.

391
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,835
You fell.

392
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,839
Through fire...

393
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,299
...and water.

394
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,303
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

395
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,223
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

396
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,784
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

397
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:27,413
...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

398
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,005
Darkness took me...

399
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,843
...and I strayed out of thought
and time.

400
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,681
Stars wheeled overhead...

401
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:49,435
...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

402
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,690
But it was not the end.

403
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,776
I felt life in me again.

404
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,239
I've been sent back...

405
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,949
...until my task is done.

406
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,284
Gandalf.

407
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,954
Gandalf?

408
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,164
Yes.

409
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,752
That was what they used to call me.

410
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,882
Gandalf the Grey.

411
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,969
That was my name.

412
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,595
Gandalf.

413
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,641
I am Gandalf the White.

414
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,731
And I come back to you now...

415
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,400
...at the turn of the tide.

416
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,528
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

417
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:45,074
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

418
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,681
That is one of the Mearas...

419
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,642
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

420
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,537
Shadowfax.

421
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,709
He is the lord of all horses...

422
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:42,256
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

423
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,067
My home lies deep in the forest...

424
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:05,196
...near the roots of the mountain.

425
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,118
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

426
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:15,164
And safe is where I'll keep you.

427
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,752
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

428
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,464
Anger festers in their hearts.

429
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,217
They will harm you if they can.

430
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:30,304
There are too few of us now.

431
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:35,268
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

432
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:48,114
The Black Gate of Mordor.

433
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,411
Oh, save us.

434
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,420
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

435
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:09,135
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

436
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,722
So good Sméagol does, master says so.

437
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,140
I did.

438
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,901
That's it, then.

439
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,737
We can't get past that.

440
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,283
Look!

441
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,910
The gate.

442
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,286
It's opening!

443
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,712
I can see a way down.

444
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,548
Sam, no!

445
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,052
Master!

446
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,473
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

447
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,393
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

448
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,645
- Now!
- No!

449
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,231
No! No, master!

450
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,401
They catch you! They catch you!

451
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,238
Don't take it to him.

452
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,911
He wants the precious.

453
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,122
Always he is looking for it.

454
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,168
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

455
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,339
But we mustn't let him have it.

456
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,847
No! There's another way.

457
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,683
More secret. A dark way.

458
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:48,646
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

459
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,189
He's up to something.

460
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,400
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

461
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,320
Yes. There's a path...

462
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,989
...and some stairs.

463
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,866
And then...

464
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,370
...a tunnel.

465
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,136
He's led us this far, Sam.

466
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,720
Mr. Frodo, no.

467
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,306
He's been true to his word.

468
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,396
No.

469
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,150
Lead the way, Sméagol.

470
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,696
Good Sméagol always helps.

471
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:09,101
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

472
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,521
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

473
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,108
...whose mind is overthrown.

474
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,571
Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

475
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,366
My lord, your son...

476
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,744
...he is dead.

477
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,039
My lord?

478
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,458
Uncle?

479
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,550
Will you not go to him?

480
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,056
Will you do nothing?

481
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,225
Be careful what you say.

482
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,560
Do not look for welcome here.

483
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:19,838
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

484
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,174
What a tragedy for the king...

485
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,344
...to lose his only son and heir.

486
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,975
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

487
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:36,021
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

488
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,690
Leave me alone, snake!

489
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,776
Oh, but you are alone.

490
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:47,199
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

491
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,786
...in the bitter watches of the night...

492
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,665
...when all your life seems to shrink.

493
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,044
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

494
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:03,757
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

495
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,886
So fair.

496
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,556
So cold.

497
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,560
Like a morning of pale spring...

498
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,188
...still clinging to winter's chill.

499
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,413
Your words are poison.

500
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,466
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

501
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,647
Ah.

502
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,651
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

503
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,697
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

504
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,799
Your staff.

505
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,723
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

506
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:19,411
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

507
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,254
He's a herald of woe.

508
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:33,884
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

509
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,428
...Théoden King.

510
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,640
He's not welcome.

511
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,896
Why should I welcome you...

512
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:50,067
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

513
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,529
A just question, my liege.

514
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,573
Late is the hour...

515
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,702
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

516
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,580
Láthspell I name him.

517
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,625
Ill news is an ill guest.

518
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:11,380
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

519
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,465
I have not passed
through fire and death...

520
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,885
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

521
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,972
His staff.

522
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:24,309
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

523
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,565
Théoden...

524
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,693
...son of Thengel...

525
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,822
...too long have you sat in the Shadows.

526
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,078
I would stay still if I were you.

527
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,330
Hearken to me!

528
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,005
I release you...

529
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,132
...from the spell.

530
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,688
You have no power here...

531
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,525
...Gandalf the Grey.

532
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:23,994
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

533
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,921
Wait.

534
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:40,218
If I go, Théoden dies.

535
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,096
You did not kill me...

536
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,474
...you will not kill him.

537
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,063
Rohan is mine.

538
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,899
Be gone.

539
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,529
I know your face.

540
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:49,955
Éowyn.

541
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,423
Gandalf?

542
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,801
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

543
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,817
Dark have been my dreams of late.

544
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:26,700
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

545
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,828
...if they grasped your sword.

546
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,958
I've only...

547
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,212
...ever served you, my lord.

548
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:25,383
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

549
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,303
Send me not from your sight.

550
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,350
No, my lord! No, my lord.

551
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,726
Let him go.

552
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,688
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

553
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,484
Get out of my way!

554
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,906
Hail, Théoden King!

555
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,058
Where is Théodred?

556
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,605
Where is my son?

557
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,194
Simbelmynë.

558
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,953
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

559
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,751
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

560
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,757
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

561
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:52,929
The young perish and the old linger.

562
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,640
That I should live...

563
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:59,144
...to see the last days of my house.

564
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:04,274
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

565
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,697
No parent should have to bury their child.

566
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,299
He was strong in life.

567
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,970
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

568
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,475
They had no warning.

569
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,061
They were unarmed.

570
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,565
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

571
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,443
Rick, cot and tree.

572
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,571
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

573
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:37,993
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

574
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,580
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

575
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,168
Ride out and meet him head-on.

576
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,423
Draw him away from your women
and children.

577
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,383
You must fight.

578
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:57,387
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

579
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,180
Éomer is loyal to you.

580
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,058
His men will return
and fight for their king.

581
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:06,104
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

582
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,027
Éomer cannot help us.

583
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:14,446
I know what it is you want of me...

584
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:17,866
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

585
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,244
I will not risk open war.

586
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,791
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

587
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,714
When last I looked...

588
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,801
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

589
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:45,935
Then what is the king's decision?

590
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,817
By order of the king...

591
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,486
...the city must empty.

592
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,490
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

593
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:02,702
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

594
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,412
Helm's Deep.

595
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,124
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

596
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,251
Who will defend them if not their king?

597
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,879
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

598
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,839
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

599
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,927
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

600
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,304
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

601
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,640
What they will get is a massacre.

602
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,685
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

603
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,856
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

604
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:35,193
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

605
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:38,488
The people of Rohan will need you.

606
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,324
The defenses have to hold.

607
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,494
They will hold.

608
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,792
The Grey Pilgrim.

609
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,586
That's what they used to call me.

610
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:58,883
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

611
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,679
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

612
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,516
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

613
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,061
At dawn, look to the east.

614
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,813
Go.

615
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,101
You have some skill with a blade.

616
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,737
Women of this country learned long ago:

617
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,531
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

618
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,533
I fear neither death nor pain.

619
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,912
What do you fear, my lady?

620
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,125
A cage.

621
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:19,255
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

622
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:23,301
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

623
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,806
You're a daughter of kings...

624
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,353
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

625
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,152
I do not think that would be your fate.

626
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:17,605
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

627
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,857
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

628
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,944
He will expect an attack on the city.

629
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,532
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

630
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,034
...the great fortress of Rohan.

631
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:35,623
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

632
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,793
They will be slow.

633
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:43,589
They will have women and children
with them.

634
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,721
Send out your Warg-riders.

635
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,530
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

636
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,366
- Why do you do that?
- What?

637
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:13,077
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

638
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,538
Because.

639
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,208
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

640
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,586
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

641
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,756
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

642
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,216
You have no idea what it did to him...

643
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,886
...what it's still doing to him.

644
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,182
I want to help him, Sam.

645
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,600
Why?

646
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,067
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

647
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,239
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

648
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:53,117
What do you know about it? Nothing!

649
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:04,295
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.

650
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,255
I do.

651
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,134
It's the Ring.

652
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,303
You can't take your eyes off it.

653
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,972
I've seen you.

654
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:19,310
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

655
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,314
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

656
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:26,150
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

657
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:29,278
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

658
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,155
Mine! My own!

659
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,158
Can't you hear yourself?

660
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:35,993
Don't you know who you sound like?

661
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,381
We wants it.

662
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:51,259
We needs it.

663
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:56,222
Must have the precious.

664
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,851
They stole it from us.

665
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:03,354
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

666
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:07,442
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

667
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,862
No. Not master.

668
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:14,866
Yes, precious. False.

669
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:19,537
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

670
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:23,166
Master's my friend.

671
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:28,379
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

672
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:32,175
Not listening. I'm not listening.

673
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:36,345
You're a liar and a thief.

674
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,556
No.

675
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:42,351
Murderer.

676
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:45,855
Go away.

677
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,399
Go away?

678
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:55,740
I hate you.

679
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,368
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

680
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:01,370
I saved us.

681
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:06,083
It was me. We survived because of me.

682
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:10,880
Not anymore.

683
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,758
What did you say?

684
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,680
Master looks after us now.

685
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:23,351
We don't need you.

686
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,603
What?

687
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,563
Leave now...

688
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:31,526
...and never come back.

689
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,735
No.

690
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:37,448
Leave now and never come back.

691
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:45,957
Leave now and never come back!

692
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,638
We told him to go away.

693
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,766
And away he goes, precious.

694
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,935
Gone! Gone! Gone!

695
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,937
Sméagol is free!

696
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,318
Look.

697
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:18,990
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

698
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,917
They are young.

699
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,628
They are tender. They are nice.

700
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:36,340
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

701
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,636
You'll make him sick, you will...

702
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,015
...behaving like that.

703
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,186
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

704
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:54,650
What's it doing?

705
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,029
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

706
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,364
It ruins it.

707
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:04,201
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.

708
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,875
What we need is a few good taters.

709
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:14,837
What's taters, precious?

710
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,714
What's taters? Eh?

711
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,633
Po-ta-toes.

712
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:22,219
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

713
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:29,226
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

714
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,396
Even you couldn't say no to that.

715
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,940
Oh, yes, we could.

716
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:38,611
Spoil a nice fish.

717
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,531
Give it to us raw...

718
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:45,743
...and wriggling.

719
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,038
You keep nasty chips.

720
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:52,041
You're hopeless.

721
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,055
Mr. Frodo?

722
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,617
Who are they?
Wicked Men.

723
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,245
Servants of Sauron.

724
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,248
They are called to Mordor.

725
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:35,459
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

726
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,796
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

727
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:44,009
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

728
01:18:44,177 --> 01:18:49,348
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

729
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:51,684
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

730
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,103
Mr. Frodo.

731
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:56,230
Look.

732
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,153
It's an oliphaunt.

733
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:13,372
No one at home will believe this.

734
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,385
Sméagol?

735
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,220
We've lingered here too long.

736
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,557
Come on, Sam.

737
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,061
Aye!

738
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,117
Bind their hands.

739
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,921
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

740
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:47,758
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

741
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,095
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

742
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,389
It's the beards.

743
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:55,724
This, in turn,
has given rise to the belief...

744
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:58,769
...that there are no Dwarf women...

745
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:03,190
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

746
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,735
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

747
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,119
GIMLl:
It's all right. Nobody panic.

748
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,455
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

749
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:40,936
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

750
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:45,149
It is mine to give to whom I will.

751
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,361
Like my heart.

752
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,490
Go to sleep.

753
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,160
I am asleep.

754
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,585
This is a dream.

755
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:10,007
Then it is a good dream.

756
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,146
Sleep.

757
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,003
Arwen...

758
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,304
Where is she?

759
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,932
The woman who gave you that jewel.

760
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,980
Our time here is ending.

761
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:33,233
Arwen's time is ending.

762
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:35,235
Let her go.

763
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,446
Let her take the ship into the west.

764
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,657
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

765
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,659
There it will be ever green.

766
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,497
But never more than memory.

767
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,834
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

768
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:54,630
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

769
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,091
She belongs with her people.

770
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:14,691
Why are you saying this?

771
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,446
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

772
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,993
It was a dream, Arwen.

773
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:26,787
Nothing more.

774
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,464
This belongs to you.

775
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,844
It was a gift.

776
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,014
Keep it.

777
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,726
My lord?

778
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:57,067
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

779
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,009
What is it?

780
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,596
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

781
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:44,198
Wargs!

782
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,420
A scout!

783
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,262
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

784
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,807
Get them out of here!

785
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,564
All riders to the head of the column.

786
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:20,275
GIMLl:
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

787
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:22,152
Come on!

788
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:36,416
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

789
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,085
- I can fight.
- No!

790
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,839
You must do this, for me.

791
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:47,719
Follow me! Hyah!

792
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:54,268
GIMLl: Forward. I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!

793
01:27:54,477 --> 01:27:57,145
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

794
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,345
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

795
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,724
That one counts as mine!

796
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:34,034
Stinking creature.

797
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,206
Aragorn!

798
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,379
Aragorn?

799
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:26,271
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

800
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:27,898
He's...

801
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:30,066
...dead.

802
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:33,570
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

803
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,492
You lie.

804
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:14,027
Get the wounded on horses.

805
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:18,490
The wolves of Isengard will return.

806
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:21,034
Leave the dead.

807
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:29,960
Come.

808
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:41,721
At last!
Helm's Deep.

809
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:44,808
There it is, Helm's Deep.

810
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,145
We're safe!

811
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,525
We're safe, my lady.

812
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:54,901
Thank you.

813
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:40,655
Mama!
Éothain!

814
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:42,365
Freda!

815
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:50,498
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

816
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:02,135
So few. So few of you have returned.

817
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,182
Our people are safe.

818
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:11,061
We have paid for it with many lives.

819
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:13,438
GIMLl:
My lady.

820
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:19,402
Lord Aragorn...

821
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:20,820
...where is he?

822
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:24,366
He fell.

823
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:50,016
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

824
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:53,103
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

825
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,439
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

826
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:59,234
Get them into the caves.

827
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:04,948
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed
if he thinks he can reach us here.

828
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:10,412
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

829
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:12,914
Its outer wall is solid rock...

830
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:16,167
...but for a small culvert at its base...

831
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:19,129
...which is little more than a drain.

832
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:26,136
How? How can fire undo stone?

833
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:30,849
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

834
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:38,481
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

835
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:42,152
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

836
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:44,904
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

837
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:46,489
Tens of thousands.

838
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:50,744
But, my lord, there is no such force.

839
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:05,759
A new power is rising.

840
01:36:05,926 --> 01:36:08,928
Its victory is at hand.

841
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,686
This night...

842
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:21,441
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

843
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,944
March to Helm's Deep!

844
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:28,615
Leave none alive!

845
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,620
To war!

846
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:42,003
There will be no dawn for Men.

847
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,231
Look. There's smoke to the south.

848
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:04,567
There is always smoke rising...

849
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:08,613
...from Isengard these days.

850
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,448
Isengard?

851
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,534
There was a time...

852
01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:16,412
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

853
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:19,916
But now he has a mind of metal...

854
01:37:20,584 --> 01:37:23,044
...and wheels.

855
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:28,299
He no longer cares for growing things.

856
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:30,260
What is it?

857
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,475
It's Saruman's army.

858
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,227
The war has started.

859
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:21,895
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

860
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:56,012
Brego.

861
01:39:22,164 --> 01:39:23,373
Arwen.

862
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,009
I have made my choice.

863
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:44,310
He is not coming back.

864
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:49,065
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

865
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,986
There is still hope.

866
01:39:57,116 --> 01:40:00,910
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

867
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:07,250
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

868
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,919
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

869
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:14,799
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

870
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:18,094
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

871
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:21,180
...Aragorn will die.

872
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,602
And there will be no comfort
for you...

873
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:30,982
...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

874
01:40:33,777 --> 01:40:36,529
He will come to death...

875
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,282
...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

876
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:44,120
...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

877
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:57,175
But you, my daughter...

878
01:40:57,968 --> 01:41:03,014
...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

879
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:07,268
...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

880
01:41:09,646 --> 01:41:12,065
Here you will dwell...

881
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:17,153
...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

882
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:20,865
...until all the world is changed...

883
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:25,536
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

884
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,254
Arwen.

885
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:44,180
There is nothing for you here...

886
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:46,390
...only death.

887
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,988
The power of the enemy is growing.

888
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:26,782
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

889
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:30,411
...to destroy the people of Rohan.

890
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:36,125
Isengard has been unleashed.

891
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:43,799
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

892
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:47,929
...the last free kingdom of Men.

893
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:52,475
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

894
01:43:56,188 --> 01:43:59,315
He senses the Ring is close.

895
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:02,944
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

896
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:07,156
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

897
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:12,578
...the quest will claim his life.

898
01:44:12,746 --> 01:44:14,914
You know this.

899
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,334
You have foreseen it.

900
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:23,923
It is the risk we all took.

901
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:32,515
In the gathering dark,
the will of the Ring grows strong.

902
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:38,104
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

903
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:43,734
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

904
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:47,530
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

905
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:51,784
...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

906
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,038
It is close now.

907
01:44:56,206 --> 01:45:00,459
So close to achieving its goal.

908
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:07,216
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

909
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:11,512
...even unto to the ending
of the world.

910
01:45:13,348 --> 01:45:15,182
The time of the Elves...

911
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:17,310
...is over.

912
01:45:18,145 --> 01:45:21,731
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

913
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:26,944
Do we let them stand alone?

914
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:32,908
What news?

915
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:35,911
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

916
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:38,914
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

917
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:43,127
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

918
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:45,713
Sauron is marshaling an army.

919
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:48,174
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

920
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:51,761
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

921
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:56,432
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

922
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,268
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

923
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,939
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

924
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:06,817
Sauron from Mordor.

925
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:11,364
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

926
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:13,240
Gondor is weak.

927
01:46:13,408 --> 01:46:16,535
Sauron will strike us soon.

928
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:19,121
And he will strike hard.

929
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:23,667
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

930
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:39,809
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

931
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:42,728
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

932
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:45,147
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

933
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:53,781
Speak.

934
01:46:54,866 --> 01:46:57,493
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

935
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:00,830
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

936
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,790
Your bodyguard?

937
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,750
His gardener.

938
01:47:05,335 --> 01:47:07,336
And where is your skulking friend?

939
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:11,173
That gangrel creature.

940
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,467
He had an ill-favored look.

941
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:17,096
There was no other.

942
01:47:21,184 --> 01:47:23,519
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

943
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,942
One we lost in Moria...

944
01:47:31,027 --> 01:47:32,528
...two were my kin...

945
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:36,449
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

946
01:47:36,616 --> 01:47:40,536
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

947
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:47,293
You're a friend of Boromir?

948
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,213
Yes.

949
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:53,382
For my part.

950
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,850
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

951
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,353
Dead?

952
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:08,564
How? When?

953
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:11,484
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

954
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:19,074
He was my brother.

955
01:48:38,303 --> 01:48:40,304
Captain Faramir!

956
01:48:41,431 --> 01:48:43,807
We found the third one.

957
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,363
You must come with me. Now.

958
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:09,708
Down there.

959
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:27,476
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

960
01:49:38,113 --> 01:49:39,613
They wait for my command.

961
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:46,161
Shall I shoot?

962
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:50,457
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

963
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:52,459
So juicy sweet

964
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:56,046
Our only wish
To catch a fish

965
01:49:56,214 --> 01:49:58,924
So juicy sweet

966
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:07,349
Wait.

967
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:11,687
This creature is bound to me.

968
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,189
And I to him.

969
01:50:17,485 --> 01:50:18,777
He is our guide.

970
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:24,908
Please...

971
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:26,952
...let me go down to him.

972
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:39,882
Sméagol.

973
01:50:40,884 --> 01:50:43,135
Master is here.

974
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:45,471
Come, Sméagol.

975
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:50,976
Trust master. Come.

976
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:57,983
We must go now?

977
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:01,779
Sméagol, you must trust master.

978
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:03,364
Follow me. Come on.

979
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:06,158
Come.

980
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:09,870
Come, Sméagol.

981
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:12,414
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

982
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,458
Come on.

983
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,547
Don't hurt him!

984
01:51:20,715 --> 01:51:23,425
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

985
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:24,927
Master!

986
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:37,898
No! No!

987
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,281
Where are you leading them?

988
01:51:48,076 --> 01:51:49,743
Answer me.

989
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:53,789
Sméagol.

990
01:51:57,210 --> 01:52:01,964
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

991
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:05,843
Cruel Men hurts us.

992
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:09,012
Master tricksed us.

993
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:12,766
Of course he did.

994
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:16,812
I told you he was tricksy.

995
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:20,023
I told you he was false.

996
01:52:20,191 --> 01:52:22,901
Master is our friend.

997
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:25,446
Our friend.

998
01:52:25,613 --> 01:52:27,781
Master betrayed us.

999
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:30,951
No. Not its business.

1000
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:34,455
Leave us alone!

1001
01:52:34,622 --> 01:52:36,999
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1002
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,501
They stole it from us!

1003
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:41,086
No. No.

1004
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:43,297
What did they steal?

1005
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:50,763
My precious!

1006
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:56,101
We have to get out of here.

1007
01:52:56,686 --> 01:52:58,687
You go. Go, now.

1008
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,150
You can do it.

1009
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:06,028
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1010
01:53:06,196 --> 01:53:08,030
Just this once.

1011
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:09,948
Put it on.

1012
01:53:10,366 --> 01:53:12,409
Disappear.

1013
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:14,536
I can't.

1014
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,875
You were right, Sam.

1015
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:23,796
You tried to tell me but...

1016
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:30,677
I'm sorry.

1017
01:53:35,225 --> 01:53:38,060
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1018
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:41,146
If I put it on...

1019
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:43,649
...he'll find me.

1020
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:47,277
He'll see.

1021
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,489
Mr. Frodo...

1022
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:59,706
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1023
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:04,920
Here in the Wild I have you...

1024
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:06,964
...two Halflings...

1025
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:10,300
...and a host of men at my call.

1026
01:54:13,596 --> 01:54:17,099
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1027
01:54:26,776 --> 01:54:30,529
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1028
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:35,158
...to show his quality.

1029
01:54:56,306 --> 01:54:57,890
No!

1030
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:02,394
Stop it!

1031
01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:03,645
Leave him alone.

1032
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:07,482
Don't you understand?

1033
01:55:08,776 --> 01:55:10,652
He's got to destroy it!

1034
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:14,072
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1035
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:15,908
To the Mountain of Fire!

1036
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:20,078
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1037
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:23,248
Please. It's such a burden.

1038
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:27,502
Will you not help him?

1039
01:55:28,838 --> 01:55:30,756
Captain?

1040
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:33,675
Prepare to leave.

1041
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:41,016
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1042
01:56:54,048 --> 01:56:56,675
He's alive!
Where is he? Where is he?

1043
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:59,928
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1044
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:03,849
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1045
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:08,061
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1046
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:10,230
Bless you, laddie.

1047
01:57:10,773 --> 01:57:12,524
Gimli, where is the king?

1048
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:27,622
You look terrible.

1049
01:58:09,373 --> 01:58:11,458
A great host, you say?

1050
01:58:11,626 --> 01:58:14,294
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1051
01:58:14,962 --> 01:58:17,964
Ten thousand strong at least.

1052
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:20,926
Ten thousand?

1053
01:58:21,344 --> 01:58:23,845
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1054
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:28,683
To destroy the world of Men.

1055
01:58:31,187 --> 01:58:33,188
They will be here by nightfall.

1056
01:58:39,028 --> 01:58:40,320
Let them come!

1057
01:58:41,823 --> 01:58:44,574
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1058
01:58:44,742 --> 01:58:47,869
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1059
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:59,047
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1060
01:58:59,215 --> 01:59:01,675
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1061
01:59:01,843 --> 01:59:04,553
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1062
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:07,139
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1063
01:59:07,723 --> 01:59:09,933
These are Uruk-hai.

1064
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:13,562
Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

1065
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:18,859
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1066
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:22,612
I know how to defend my own keep.

1067
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:32,622
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1068
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:38,044
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1069
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:40,922
Crops can be resown...

1070
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:44,092
...homes rebuilt.

1071
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:47,262
Within these walls...

1072
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,097
...we will outlast them.

1073
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:51,683
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1074
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:53,435
They come to destroy its people...

1075
01:59:53,603 --> 01:59:56,104
...down to the last child.

1076
01:59:56,939 --> 01:59:59,232
What would you have me do?

1077
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,109
Look at my men.

1078
02:00:01,277 --> 02:00:03,028
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1079
02:00:05,239 --> 02:00:09,618
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1080
02:00:09,785 --> 02:00:12,829
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1081
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:18,376
Send out riders, my lord.

1082
02:00:18,669 --> 02:00:21,546
You must call for aid.

1083
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,093
And who will come?

1084
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:29,095
Elves?

1085
02:00:29,263 --> 02:00:31,306
Dwarves?

1086
02:00:32,099 --> 02:00:34,976
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1087
02:00:35,811 --> 02:00:38,063
The old alliances are dead.

1088
02:00:38,481 --> 02:00:41,316
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1089
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:43,652
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1090
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:47,864
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1091
02:00:48,032 --> 02:00:49,991
Where was Gon...?

1092
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:54,579
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1093
02:00:56,165 --> 02:00:58,667
...we are alone.

1094
02:01:05,508 --> 02:01:07,259
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1095
02:01:07,426 --> 02:01:08,677
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1096
02:01:08,844 --> 02:01:12,347
There is no time. War is upon us.

1097
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:14,349
Secure the gate.

1098
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:21,648
We Ents have not troubled...

1099
02:01:21,857 --> 02:01:25,193
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1100
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:28,947
...for a very long time.

1101
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:34,995
But now, something
is about to happen...

1102
02:01:35,162 --> 02:01:37,497
...that has not happened...

1103
02:01:37,707 --> 02:01:40,166
...for an age.

1104
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,628
Entmoot.

1105
02:01:44,005 --> 02:01:45,046
What's that?

1106
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:48,300
'Tis a gathering.

1107
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:52,053
A gathering of what?

1108
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:12,365
Beech. Oak.

1109
02:02:12,533 --> 02:02:14,409
Chestnut. Ash.

1110
02:02:14,702 --> 02:02:16,661
Good. Good. Good.

1111
02:02:16,829 --> 02:02:19,205
Many have come.

1112
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:29,507
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1113
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:32,260
...will go to war.

1114
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:44,272
Move back! Move to the caves!

1115
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:47,442
Keep moving.
Quickly now.

1116
02:03:41,997 --> 02:03:45,291
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1117
02:03:46,335 --> 02:03:48,169
These are no soldiers.

1118
02:03:50,172 --> 02:03:53,633
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1119
02:03:57,555 --> 02:04:00,473
Look at them. They're frightened.

1120
02:04:00,641 --> 02:04:02,100
You can see it in their eyes.

1121
02:04:16,532 --> 02:04:17,907
Aragorn.

1122
02:04:23,038 --> 02:04:25,206
Then I shall die as one of them!

1123
02:04:31,672 --> 02:04:33,506
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.

1124
02:04:34,049 --> 02:04:36,050
Let him be.

1125
02:04:37,511 --> 02:04:42,974
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory.

1126
02:04:47,229 --> 02:04:49,147
My lord?

1127
02:04:51,233 --> 02:04:53,776
Who am I, Gamling?

1128
02:04:57,156 --> 02:05:01,075
You are our king, sire.

1129
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:07,332
And do you trust your king?

1130
02:05:08,876 --> 02:05:12,045
Your men, my lord...

1131
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:15,006
...will follow you to whatever end.

1132
02:05:21,889 --> 02:05:23,765
To whatever end.

1133
02:05:33,609 --> 02:05:37,195
Where is the horse and the rider?

1134
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:40,448
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1135
02:05:41,951 --> 02:05:46,371
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1136
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:50,625
Like wind in the meadow.

1137
02:05:54,296 --> 02:05:58,049
The days have gone down in the West...

1138
02:05:58,759 --> 02:06:01,386
...behind the hills...

1139
02:06:03,305 --> 02:06:04,931
...into Shadow.

1140
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:16,818
How did it come to this?

1141
02:06:21,031 --> 02:06:23,866
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1142
02:06:41,427 --> 02:06:42,760
Give me your sword.

1143
02:06:52,229 --> 02:06:53,438
What is your name?

1144
02:06:53,981 --> 02:06:56,357
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1145
02:06:58,485 --> 02:07:01,112
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1146
02:07:03,073 --> 02:07:05,033
They say that it is hopeless.

1147
02:07:22,885 --> 02:07:24,510
This is a good sword.

1148
02:07:26,555 --> 02:07:28,890
Haleth, son of Háma...

1149
02:07:33,228 --> 02:07:35,396
...there is always hope.

1150
02:07:58,337 --> 02:08:01,714
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1151
02:08:01,882 --> 02:08:03,424
Forgive me.

1152
02:08:03,592 --> 02:08:05,051
I was wrong to despair.

1153
02:08:14,269 --> 02:08:17,063
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1154
02:08:20,484 --> 02:08:22,568
It's a little tight across the chest.

1155
02:08:28,742 --> 02:08:30,702
That is no Orc horn.

1156
02:08:36,375 --> 02:08:38,209
Send for the king.

1157
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:41,963
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!

1158
02:09:13,662 --> 02:09:15,329
How is this possible?

1159
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:19,959
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1160
02:09:20,127 --> 02:09:23,337
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1161
02:09:24,047 --> 02:09:28,301
Long ago we fought and died together.

1162
02:09:30,554 --> 02:09:33,473
We come to honor that allegiance.

1163
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:43,858
You are most welcome.

1164
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:53,201
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1165
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:30,071
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.

1166
02:10:34,952 --> 02:10:39,163
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1167
02:10:45,295 --> 02:10:47,088
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1168
02:10:47,756 --> 02:10:50,258
Let's hope they last the night.

1169
02:11:50,235 --> 02:11:52,236
ARAGORN

1170
02:12:31,693 --> 02:12:34,487
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1171
02:12:35,739 --> 02:12:37,531
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1172
02:13:40,762 --> 02:13:42,555
So it begins.

1173
02:14:09,416 --> 02:14:10,791
Did they hit anything?

1174
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,461
Give them a volley.

1175
02:14:13,628 --> 02:14:15,713
- Fire!
- Fire!

1176
02:14:31,438 --> 02:14:33,147
Send them to me! Come on!

1177
02:14:53,919 --> 02:14:55,002
Good!

1178
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,762
Swords! Swords!

1179
02:15:34,793 --> 02:15:36,919
Legolas! Two already!

1180
02:15:37,087 --> 02:15:38,712
I'm on 17!

1181
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,966
Huh? I'll have no pointy-ear
outscoring me!

1182
02:15:48,765 --> 02:15:50,516
Nineteen!

1183
02:16:27,762 --> 02:16:29,180
Merry.

1184
02:16:31,766 --> 02:16:35,603
We have just agreed.

1185
02:16:43,612 --> 02:16:45,112
Yes?

1186
02:16:45,614 --> 02:16:49,783
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1187
02:16:50,911 --> 02:16:54,121
...and we have agreed...

1188
02:16:54,623 --> 02:16:58,626
...you are not Orcs.

1189
02:16:59,544 --> 02:17:01,670
Well, that's good news.

1190
02:17:01,838 --> 02:17:05,966
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1191
02:17:06,635 --> 02:17:10,429
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1192
02:17:10,597 --> 02:17:12,139
Hasty?

1193
02:17:12,682 --> 02:17:14,600
Our friends are out there.

1194
02:17:14,768 --> 02:17:18,938
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1195
02:17:19,272 --> 02:17:21,523
War? Yes.

1196
02:17:21,691 --> 02:17:23,609
It affects us all.

1197
02:17:24,402 --> 02:17:28,447
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1198
02:17:28,657 --> 02:17:30,574
...it takes a long time...

1199
02:17:30,742 --> 02:17:35,663
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1200
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:40,042
...and we never say anything...

1201
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:44,129
...unless it is worth taking...

1202
02:17:44,297 --> 02:17:48,342
...a long time to say.

1203
02:17:49,135 --> 02:17:52,471
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1204
02:17:52,639 --> 02:17:53,681
Nineteen!

1205
02:17:54,266 --> 02:17:56,141
Twenty!

1206
02:17:56,309 --> 02:17:57,977
Twenty-one!

1207
02:17:58,144 --> 02:18:02,523
Twenty-two and 23!

1208
02:18:08,029 --> 02:18:09,363
Causeway!

1209
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:20,207
Is this it?

1210
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:23,294
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1211
02:19:49,297 --> 02:19:50,631
Brace the gate!

1212
02:20:08,983 --> 02:20:11,235
Hold them! Stand firm!

1213
02:20:19,119 --> 02:20:20,452
Aragorn!

1214
02:20:25,083 --> 02:20:26,291
Gimli!

1215
02:21:14,716 --> 02:21:18,677
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1216
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:23,474
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1217
02:21:24,267 --> 02:21:26,393
How can that be your decision?!

1218
02:21:27,061 --> 02:21:30,689
This is not our war.

1219
02:21:30,982 --> 02:21:33,192
But you're part of this world!

1220
02:21:37,322 --> 02:21:39,156
Aren't you?!

1221
02:21:43,244 --> 02:21:45,579
You must help. Please.

1222
02:21:46,915 --> 02:21:49,666
You must do something.

1223
02:21:49,918 --> 02:21:54,254
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1224
02:21:55,423 --> 02:21:59,176
But your part in this tale is over.

1225
02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:01,595
Go back to your home.

1226
02:22:11,606 --> 02:22:13,857
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1227
02:22:14,025 --> 02:22:15,901
We don't belong here, Merry.

1228
02:22:16,069 --> 02:22:18,320
It's too big for us.

1229
02:22:18,488 --> 02:22:21,156
What can we do in the end?

1230
02:22:23,451 --> 02:22:26,119
We've got the Shire.

1231
02:22:26,621 --> 02:22:29,164
Maybe we should go home.

1232
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,253
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1233
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:39,299
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1234
02:22:39,467 --> 02:22:41,093
And...

1235
02:22:42,887 --> 02:22:45,973
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1236
02:22:49,477 --> 02:22:52,437
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1237
02:23:11,958 --> 02:23:13,166
Aragorn!

1238
02:23:13,334 --> 02:23:15,711
Fall back to the Keep!

1239
02:23:15,878 --> 02:23:19,006
Get your men out of there!

1240
02:23:28,641 --> 02:23:30,309
Haldir!

1241
02:23:34,397 --> 02:23:37,691
GIMLl: What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1242
02:23:56,878 --> 02:23:58,128
Haldir!

1243
02:24:38,878 --> 02:24:40,379
Brace the gate!

1244
02:24:43,257 --> 02:24:44,591
Hold them!

1245
02:24:46,427 --> 02:24:49,763
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1246
02:25:13,621 --> 02:25:15,580
Make way!

1247
02:25:18,459 --> 02:25:20,210
We cannot hold much longer!

1248
02:25:26,175 --> 02:25:29,761
Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1249
02:25:29,929 --> 02:25:32,472
As long as you can give me.

1250
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:34,307
Gimli!

1251
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:37,144
Timbers!

1252
02:25:37,311 --> 02:25:39,312
Brace the gate!

1253
02:25:53,578 --> 02:25:55,787
Oh, come on. We can take them.

1254
02:25:56,622 --> 02:25:58,248
It's a long way.

1255
02:26:03,504 --> 02:26:05,255
Toss me.

1256
02:26:06,424 --> 02:26:08,258
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1257
02:26:08,426 --> 02:26:10,010
You'll have to toss me!

1258
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:16,850
Don't tell the Elf.

1259
02:26:17,393 --> 02:26:19,186
Not a word.

1260
02:26:34,410 --> 02:26:35,869
Shore up the door!

1261
02:26:36,037 --> 02:26:38,121
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.

1262
02:26:38,289 --> 02:26:39,372
Watch our backs!

1263
02:26:43,503 --> 02:26:45,712
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1264
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,097
Hold fast the gate!

1265
02:27:41,310 --> 02:27:44,271
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1266
02:27:48,985 --> 02:27:50,610
Aragorn!

1267
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:26,479
Pull everybody back.

1268
02:28:26,814 --> 02:28:28,648
Pull them back.

1269
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:33,320
Fall back!

1270
02:28:34,488 --> 02:28:36,156
They have broken through!

1271
02:28:36,324 --> 02:28:38,617
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1272
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:40,994
Fall back!
Retreat!

1273
02:28:41,162 --> 02:28:43,788
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1274
02:28:43,956 --> 02:28:46,207
Into the Keep!

1275
02:28:57,678 --> 02:29:02,641
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1276
02:29:02,808 --> 02:29:07,520
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1277
02:29:13,235 --> 02:29:14,527
Wait! Stop!

1278
02:29:15,404 --> 02:29:16,905
Stop!

1279
02:29:20,034 --> 02:29:21,743
Turn around.

1280
02:29:22,662 --> 02:29:25,372
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1281
02:29:25,539 --> 02:29:30,543
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1282
02:29:30,878 --> 02:29:33,546
Yes. Exactly.

1283
02:29:33,714 --> 02:29:36,967
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1284
02:29:37,134 --> 02:29:39,803
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1285
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:41,972
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1286
02:29:44,558 --> 02:29:47,602
That doesn't make sense to me.

1287
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:48,937
But then...

1288
02:29:49,105 --> 02:29:51,815
...you are very small.

1289
02:29:51,983 --> 02:29:53,733
Perhaps you're right.

1290
02:29:56,404 --> 02:29:57,904
South it is, then.

1291
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:02,742
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1292
02:30:04,787 --> 02:30:07,580
I always like going south.

1293
02:30:07,748 --> 02:30:12,043
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1294
02:30:12,628 --> 02:30:15,088
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1295
02:30:15,256 --> 02:30:17,215
No, we won't.

1296
02:30:17,925 --> 02:30:20,218
Not this time.

1297
02:30:26,851 --> 02:30:27,892
Look!

1298
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,938
Osgiliath burns!

1299
02:30:32,106 --> 02:30:33,565
Mordor has come.

1300
02:30:34,692 --> 02:30:37,110
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1301
02:30:38,446 --> 02:30:40,613
It has only the power to destroy.

1302
02:30:41,532 --> 02:30:42,949
Please...

1303
02:30:43,117 --> 02:30:44,784
...let me go.

1304
02:30:45,786 --> 02:30:47,412
Hurry.

1305
02:30:50,875 --> 02:30:52,292
Faramir!

1306
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:54,961
You must let me go!

1307
02:30:55,379 --> 02:30:58,798
And those little family of field mice...

1308
02:30:58,966 --> 02:31:01,801
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1309
02:31:02,553 --> 02:31:05,847
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1310
02:31:17,026 --> 02:31:19,986
Many of these trees were my friends.

1311
02:31:20,654 --> 02:31:25,325
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1312
02:31:26,494 --> 02:31:27,660
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1313
02:31:27,828 --> 02:31:30,622
They had voices of their own.

1314
02:31:32,833 --> 02:31:35,418
Saruman.

1315
02:31:35,753 --> 02:31:38,838
A wizard should know better!

1316
02:31:53,104 --> 02:31:56,731
There is no curse in Elvish...

1317
02:31:56,941 --> 02:31:59,609
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1318
02:31:59,777 --> 02:32:02,112
...for this treachery.

1319
02:32:03,197 --> 02:32:07,492
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1320
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:10,286
...with rock and stone.

1321
02:32:34,228 --> 02:32:35,353
Yes.

1322
02:32:36,438 --> 02:32:37,897
Come, my friends.

1323
02:32:39,233 --> 02:32:43,403
The Ents are going to war.

1324
02:32:43,571 --> 02:32:45,363
It is likely...

1325
02:32:45,531 --> 02:32:49,075
...that we go to our doom.

1326
02:32:50,452 --> 02:32:52,912
Last march...

1327
02:32:53,455 --> 02:32:55,498
...of the Ents.

1328
02:33:43,631 --> 02:33:47,342
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.

1329
02:33:47,509 --> 02:33:49,594
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1330
02:33:52,348 --> 02:33:53,806
Mr. Frodo?

1331
02:33:54,141 --> 02:33:58,228
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1332
02:33:58,395 --> 02:34:00,897
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1333
02:34:15,204 --> 02:34:16,621
Take them to my father.

1334
02:34:18,165 --> 02:34:21,167
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1335
02:34:23,587 --> 02:34:26,631
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1336
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:30,510
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1337
02:34:31,136 --> 02:34:33,888
You want to know
why your brother died?

1338
02:34:34,348 --> 02:34:38,101
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1339
02:34:38,269 --> 02:34:40,186
He tried to kill him!

1340
02:34:40,354 --> 02:34:42,689
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1341
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:45,316
Watch out!

1342
02:34:56,203 --> 02:34:57,370
Mr. Frodo?

1343
02:34:59,999 --> 02:35:01,833
They're here.

1344
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:07,380
They've come.

1345
02:35:09,967 --> 02:35:11,884
NazgûI!

1346
02:35:33,991 --> 02:35:36,159
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1347
02:35:37,953 --> 02:35:40,204
Take cover!

1348
02:35:57,514 --> 02:35:59,098
The fortress is taken.

1349
02:35:59,850 --> 02:36:01,059
It is over.

1350
02:36:01,226 --> 02:36:05,146
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1351
02:36:05,314 --> 02:36:08,274
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1352
02:36:10,986 --> 02:36:12,403
They're breaking in!

1353
02:36:15,032 --> 02:36:17,533
They're past the door!

1354
02:36:20,871 --> 02:36:24,999
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1355
02:36:27,669 --> 02:36:29,629
Is there no other way?

1356
02:36:31,173 --> 02:36:34,258
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1357
02:36:34,927 --> 02:36:37,136
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1358
02:36:41,975 --> 02:36:44,394
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1359
02:36:44,561 --> 02:36:47,438
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1360
02:36:49,608 --> 02:36:52,985
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1361
02:36:57,658 --> 02:36:59,117
Ride out with me.

1362
02:37:03,205 --> 02:37:04,831
Ride out and meet them.

1363
02:37:05,624 --> 02:37:07,792
For death and glory.

1364
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:09,335
For Rohan.

1365
02:37:10,838 --> 02:37:12,338
For your people.

1366
02:37:13,048 --> 02:37:15,007
The sun is rising.

1367
02:37:19,513 --> 02:37:22,515
Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.

1368
02:37:22,683 --> 02:37:24,058
At dawn...

1369
02:37:24,226 --> 02:37:25,935
...look to the east.

1370
02:37:30,149 --> 02:37:35,903
Yes.

1371
02:37:37,239 --> 02:37:39,657
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1372
02:37:39,825 --> 02:37:42,618
...shall sound in the Deep...

1373
02:37:43,036 --> 02:37:45,037
...one last time.

1374
02:37:45,205 --> 02:37:46,706
Yes!

1375
02:37:49,751 --> 02:37:53,546
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1376
02:38:01,346 --> 02:38:02,680
Fell deeds, awake.

1377
02:38:03,891 --> 02:38:04,974
Now for wrath...

1378
02:38:05,142 --> 02:38:08,561
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1379
02:38:15,569 --> 02:38:17,862
Forth Eorlingas!

1380
02:39:05,619 --> 02:39:06,869
Gandalf.

1381
02:39:14,127 --> 02:39:17,797
Théoden King stands alone.

1382
02:39:18,423 --> 02:39:20,591
Not alone.

1383
02:39:20,968 --> 02:39:22,134
Rohirrim!

1384
02:39:28,016 --> 02:39:29,183
Éomer.

1385
02:39:29,351 --> 02:39:31,894
To the king!

1386
02:40:49,514 --> 02:40:51,265
Yes!

1387
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:03,653
A hit. A fine hit.

1388
02:41:28,428 --> 02:41:30,888
Break the dam!

1389
02:41:31,056 --> 02:41:34,475
Release the river!

1390
02:42:01,795 --> 02:42:04,547
Pippin! Hold on!

1391
02:42:09,803 --> 02:42:12,763
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1392
02:42:54,097 --> 02:42:56,140
What are you doing?

1393
02:43:04,691 --> 02:43:06,275
Where are you going?

1394
02:44:04,417 --> 02:44:05,751
It's me.

1395
02:44:08,255 --> 02:44:10,464
It's your Sam.

1396
02:44:14,803 --> 02:44:17,429
Don't you know your Sam?

1397
02:44:35,156 --> 02:44:38,534
I can't do this, Sam.

1398
02:44:39,452 --> 02:44:41,453
I know.

1399
02:44:42,455 --> 02:44:44,790
It's all wrong.

1400
02:44:45,542 --> 02:44:47,585
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1401
02:44:54,968 --> 02:44:57,094
But we are.

1402
02:45:03,476 --> 02:45:06,520
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1403
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:09,106
The ones that really mattered.

1404
02:45:10,150 --> 02:45:13,152
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1405
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:16,280
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1406
02:45:16,448 --> 02:45:19,366
...because how could the end be happy?

1407
02:45:21,953 --> 02:45:24,163
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1408
02:45:24,331 --> 02:45:26,290
...when so much bad had happened?

1409
02:45:26,875 --> 02:45:29,126
Victory!

1410
02:45:29,294 --> 02:45:31,629
We have victory!

1411
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:37,426
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1412
02:45:37,594 --> 02:45:39,011
...this shadow.

1413
02:45:39,179 --> 02:45:42,264
Even darkness must pass.

1414
02:45:42,432 --> 02:45:44,850
A new day will come.

1415
02:45:45,727 --> 02:45:50,022
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1416
02:45:51,691 --> 02:45:54,068
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1417
02:45:54,235 --> 02:45:55,861
...that meant something.

1418
02:45:56,029 --> 02:45:58,989
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1419
02:45:59,908 --> 02:46:03,744
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1420
02:46:03,912 --> 02:46:05,621
I know now.

1421
02:46:06,539 --> 02:46:08,749
Folk in those stories...

1422
02:46:08,917 --> 02:46:13,045
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1423
02:46:13,213 --> 02:46:15,464
They kept going...

1424
02:46:16,132 --> 02:46:19,385
...because they were holding
on to something.

1425
02:46:21,012 --> 02:46:23,305
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1426
02:46:35,235 --> 02:46:39,196
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1427
02:46:39,364 --> 02:46:41,991
And it's worth fighting for.

1428
02:47:08,893 --> 02:47:13,188
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1429
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:17,901
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1430
02:47:18,069 --> 02:47:20,279
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1431
02:47:24,617 --> 02:47:26,035
Then it is forfeit.

1432
02:47:28,788 --> 02:47:30,581
Release them.

1433
02:47:41,134 --> 02:47:46,305
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1434
02:47:53,480 --> 02:47:56,482
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1435
02:47:57,150 --> 02:48:00,652
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1436
02:48:05,825 --> 02:48:09,244
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1437
02:48:10,205 --> 02:48:13,457
...somewhere in the wilderness.

1438
02:48:16,753 --> 02:48:20,172
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1439
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:21,673
What?

1440
02:48:21,841 --> 02:48:25,844
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "

1441
02:48:26,012 --> 02:48:29,264
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories. "

1442
02:48:29,432 --> 02:48:32,351
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1443
02:48:32,519 --> 02:48:34,186
"Yes, my boy.

1444
02:48:34,354 --> 02:48:38,190
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "

1445
02:48:38,358 --> 02:48:40,859
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1446
02:48:41,027 --> 02:48:42,945
"Samwise the Brave. "

1447
02:48:43,113 --> 02:48:45,864
I want to hear more about Sam.

1448
02:48:50,161 --> 02:48:53,163
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1449
02:48:54,499 --> 02:48:58,544
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1450
02:48:59,629 --> 02:49:01,004
So was I.

1451
02:49:09,889 --> 02:49:12,558
"Samwise the Brave. "

1452
02:49:16,855 --> 02:49:18,188
Sméagol?

1453
02:49:18,356 --> 02:49:21,233
We're not going
to wait for you. Come on.

1454
02:49:21,401 --> 02:49:23,360
Master.

1455
02:49:23,528 --> 02:49:26,488
Master looks after us.

1456
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:30,075
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1457
02:49:30,243 --> 02:49:32,703
Master broke his promise.

1458
02:49:32,871 --> 02:49:35,038
Don't ask Sméagol.

1459
02:49:35,206 --> 02:49:38,417
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1460
02:49:38,585 --> 02:49:41,420
Master betrayed us.

1461
02:49:41,588 --> 02:49:44,673
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1462
02:49:44,841 --> 02:49:48,760
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1463
02:49:48,928 --> 02:49:51,638
Kill him! Kill him!

1464
02:49:51,806 --> 02:49:53,307
Kill them both!

1465
02:49:53,474 --> 02:49:57,102
And then we take the precious...

1466
02:49:57,270 --> 02:50:00,814
...and we be the master!

1467
02:50:01,482 --> 02:50:04,151
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1468
02:50:04,319 --> 02:50:06,987
Eyes always watching.

1469
02:50:07,155 --> 02:50:10,741
Then we stabs them out.

1470
02:50:10,909 --> 02:50:15,412
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1471
02:50:15,580 --> 02:50:19,041
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1472
02:50:19,209 --> 02:50:21,919
Kill them both.

1473
02:50:22,086 --> 02:50:24,588
Yes. No! No!

1474
02:50:24,756 --> 02:50:28,467
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1475
02:50:29,135 --> 02:50:31,762
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1476
02:50:31,930 --> 02:50:34,514
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
Sméagol?

1477
02:50:34,682 --> 02:50:40,103
We could let her do it.

1478
02:50:41,064 --> 02:50:45,192
Yes. She could do it.

1479
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:49,947
Yes, precious, she could.

1480
02:50:50,114 --> 02:50:56,161
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1481
02:50:57,080 --> 02:50:58,914
Once they're dead.

1482
02:50:59,082 --> 02:51:02,042
Shh.

1483
02:51:04,337 --> 02:51:08,006
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.
